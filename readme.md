This   web-App will be used for MTS AV  equipment Rental fleet.
The initial phase of the web-app is to create an audio visual equipment inventory database
which will be managed by two groups of users: Staff-admin Staff-user. Staff-users will be able
to view a single and all AV equipment and also will be able to add new entry  to the inventory.
Admin-staff will have unrestricted access to create, read , edit and delete all AV equipment.

The second phase of this project is to implement a scanning feature for signing out AV-equipment.
 The last phase is to allow non-staff members to view all available equipment and allow
 them to reserve a piece of equipment online  before coming to the rental office.

In order to use this web-app everyone needs to be authenticated by creating an account and
 activate your account through the provided e-mail address.
 I have created the authentication portion for the users, created dummy users,
tripods, projectors and microphones tables in my mts-webapp database. Users can now view,
create, edit and delete using the pivot table to query  for a listing all AV-equipment to display on
 equipment listing page.
